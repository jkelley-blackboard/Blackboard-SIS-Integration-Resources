# Course / Organization Membership

**SIS Object:** Course or Organization Memberships (Enrollments and Staff Assignments)  
**Endpoint:** `/endpoint/membership/`  
**Insert/Update behavior:** Smart Insert or Update  
**Delete behavior:** Disable

The Membership object creates and manages enrollments and staff assignments for Courses and Organizations. Courses and Organizations use the same fields but are submitted to separate endpoints.

## Notes

- **Course and Organization memberships use the same fields** but different endpoints and key headers (`external_course_key` vs `external_organization_key`).
- **`primary_instructor`** is only valid for course roles that have the 'treat as instructor' flag enabled. A `Y` value on any other role type is silently rejected.
- **`cartridge_ind`** is the only confirmed-deprecated field — remove it from any existing feeds. `photo_link` (Image URL) is active, not deprecated, despite once being listed that way.
- **Website Name and URL fields (`link_name_1/2/3`, `link_url_1/2/3`) are deprecated** — not displayed or used anywhere in the application. The Description fields (`link_desc_1/2/3`) are not known to be deprecated.
- **The Field Mapping page also lists "Batch Uid," "Replacement Batch Uid," "Course ID," and "Move Cross-listed Enrollment"** as Learn Enrollments fields — "Batch Uid" shows its source as "Membership External Key." This is misleading: Blackboard Learn has no actual membership batch UID / external key concept, and none of these four fields appear anywhere in the Header Override list, meaning none of them can be populated from the flat file at all. Treat "Membership External Key" as an internal Field Mapping page label, not a real header or a value you need to supply.
